            Louisville police officer indicted in Breonna Taylors case

        </p>
            <p id="cont1">Two Louisville police officers were shot Wednesday night as protesters marched following news that only one of the three officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death was indicted on first-degree wanton endangerment charges.


                        The other two officers who also fired shots during the botched March raid were not indicted, meaning no officer was charged with killing the 26-year-old Black emergency room technician and an aspiring nurse.A grand jury didn’t charge any officers with killing Ms. Taylor in her apartment, prompting protests nationwide. A former detective was indicted on three counts of “wanton endangerment.”

            U.S. mourns the death of SCOTUS Judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg
        </p>
            <p id="cont3">
                Someone who used whatever talent she had to do her work to the very best of her ability. And to help repair tears in her society, to make things a little better through the use of whatever ability she has. To do something, as my colleague David Souter would say, outside myself. ‘Cause I’ve gotten much more satisfaction for the things that I’ve done for which I was not paid.” This is what Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court,  wanted to be remembered for.
